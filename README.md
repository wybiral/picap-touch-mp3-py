# Bare Conductive Pi Cap Polyphonic Touch MP3 Utility

The code and sound files in this repo were used to make the capacitive touch musical Christmas tree featured in this YouTube video:

Example MP3 playback code for the [Bare Conductive Pi Cap](http://www.bareconductive.com/shop/pi-cap/). You need twelve MP3 files named TRACK000.mp3 to TRACK011.mp3 in a folder called `tracks` inside this folder. When you touch electrode E0, TRACK000.mp3 will play. When you touch electrode E1, TRACK001.mp3 will play, and so on. Playback is polyphonic, which is nice.
